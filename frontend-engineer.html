            <p>Dr Me is a telemedicine startup based in Melbourne, Australia. We make it possible for patients to see a doctor from the convenience of their smart phone.</p>
            <p>Our tech team is small but diverse. We eat lunch together most days and try to keep a positive, encouraging environment. We are often teaching each other and staying up to date on the Latest New Thing™.</p>
            <p>We care about tooling and providing the best development experience we can. We move quickly but do regular iteration planning with the whole team so everyone stays on the same page. We’re not afraid to ask questions when we’re stuck and respect that uninterrupted work can be the best kind of work.</p>

            Role
          </h3>
          <div class="job__section__content">
            <p>Our app is built on a modern web-app stack (React, Redux, CSS Modules) and published across iOS and Android with Cordova.</p>
            <p>We also work with third-party platforms and integrations</p>
            <p>We are looking for a product-focused engineer who has had experience with web apps. Someone who tries to keep their JavaScript DRY and is not afraid to spend some time thinking through a problem before they get started.</p>
            <p>You should be familiar with React and Redux and can hopefully teach us a few things. Experience with an end-to-end testing framework, continuous integration and Ruby/Rails would be seen as a bonus.</p>
